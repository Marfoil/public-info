## GymRat: Privacy policy

Welcome to the GymRat app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Javier Marfil. The source code is private on GitHub under the MIT license but bugs and issues can be discussed on this repo; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and user information) created by the you (the user) stored on a private server only, and can be simply erased by removing the diets/workouts from the app.
For the user information im working on it, but sirelly the option will come soon!

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of personally identifiable information required by the app is the following:



<br/>

| Personal information | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `User name` | This is required to be used as the reference for you (the user) on the different sections of the app |
| `User email` | Required to log into the app, also all the diffefent information saved (weight, diet, etc.) Is linked to this email so no one else can see it. |
| `User password` | Required to log into the app, it is encrypted before saving it so even I cannot see the password |
| `Weight` | Used to create the weight graph, linked to your user so no one else have access to it |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Javier Marfil.
